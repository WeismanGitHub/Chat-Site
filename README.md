  ## Description
  I'm revisiting a [past project](https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website) that I originally built using JavaScript. However, this time, I've made a strategic decision to leverage the power of ASP.NET to drive the backend infrastructure. On the frontend, I utilized the powerful combination of of Typescript and React.js to create a robust and interactive user interface.

  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
