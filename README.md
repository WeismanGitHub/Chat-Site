  # Chat Site v2
  ## Description
  
  This website provides users with a platform for connecting, adding friends, and engaging in real-time one-on-one or group chats, among other features.

  I'm revisiting a <a href="https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website" className="link-underline-primary">prior project</a> that I developed with <strong>JavaScript</strong>. However, this time, I've strategically chosen to harness the capabilities of <strong>ASP.NET</strong> and the <strong>FastEndpoints</strong> library, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure. Additionally, with a powerful combination of <strong>Typescript, React, and Bootstrap</strong>, I've created a well-designed and easy to use front-end.
  
  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
  ## Instructions
  To run the tests, you need to create an `appsettings.Testing.json` file in the `API` project root. It must match the structure of `appsettings.json` and have the secrets filled in.
