  ## Description
  I'm revisiting a [prior project](https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website) I initially developed with JavaScript, but now, I've strategically opted to harness the capabilities of ASP.NET & Blazor, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure.
  
  Azure Active Directory B2C plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security of the application. By integrating this powerful authentication system, I've not only safeguarded user data but also streamlined the login and registration processes, making it more user-friendly.

  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
