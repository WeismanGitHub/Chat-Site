  # Chat Site v2
  ## Description
  This website provides users with a platform for connecting, adding friends, and engaging in real-time one-on-one or group chats, among other features.
  
  I'm revisiting a [prior project](https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website) I initially developed with just JavaScript. However, now, I've strategically chosen to harness the capabilities of ASP.NET and the FastEndpoints library, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure. Additionally, with the powerful combination of Typescript, React, and Bootstrap, I've created a well-designed and easy to use front-end.
  
  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also push the boundaries of what I can achieve.

  ## Instructions
  instructions for building/running

  To run the tests, you need to create an `appsettings.Testing.json` file in the `API` project root. It must match the structure of `appsettings.json` and have the secrets filled in.
