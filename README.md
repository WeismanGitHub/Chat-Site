  # Chat Site v2
  ## Description
  
  This website provides users with a platform for engaging in real-time chat rooms.

  I'm revisiting a <a href="https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website" className="link-underline-primary">prior project</a> that I developed with <strong>JavaScript</strong>. However, this time, I've chosen to use <strong>ASP.NET</strong> and the <strong>FastEndpoints</strong> library for my back-end. On the front-end, I used <strong>Typescript, React, and Bootstrap</strong>.
  
  The primary goal of this project is to improve my <strong>C#</strong> skills. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I reinforce my existing knowledge but also push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
  ## Instructions
  To run the tests, you need to create an `appsettings.Testing.json` file in the `API` project root. It must match the structure of `appsettings.json` and have the secrets filled in.
