  ## Description
  This website provides users with a platform for connecting, adding friends, and engaging in real-time one-on-one or group chats, among other features.
  
  I'm revisiting a [prior project](https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website) I initially developed with just JavaScript. However, now, I've strategically chosen to harness the capabilities of ASP.NET and the FastEndpoints library, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure. With the powerful combination of Typescript and React.js, I've created a well-designed and easy to use frontend.
  
  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
