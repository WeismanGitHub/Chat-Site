  ## Description
  I'm revisiting a [prior project](https://github.com/WeismanGitHub/Chat-Website) I initially developed with JavaScript, but now, I've strategically opted to harness the capabilities of ASP.NET for the backend, ensuring a more robust and scalable infrastructure. On the frontend, I've employed Blazor to craft an interactive user interface, empowering users to effortlessly connect, add friends, and participate in real-time one-on-one or group chats.

  The driving force behind this endeavor is my unwavering commitment to elevating my C# programming skills to new levels of mastery. By revisiting and enhancing my prior work, I aim to not only reinforce my existing knowledge but also to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
